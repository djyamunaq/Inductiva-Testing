This is an experimental tool which tries to merge individual processor
meshes back into one master mesh. Use it if the original master mesh has
been deleted or if the processor meshes have been modified (topology change).
This tool will write the resulting mesh to a new time step and construct
xxxxProcAddressing files in the processor meshes so reconstructPar can be
used to regenerate the fields on the master mesh.

Not well tested & use at your own risk!

Merge tolerance : 1e-07
Write tolerance : 1e-06
Doing geometric matching on correct procBoundaries only.
This assumes a correct decomposition.
